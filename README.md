In this repo you can find a model that is trained for detecting cars, trucks, road signs and traffic lights in the game "Euro Truck Simulator 2". The model is trained using the road map that you can 
in authors' profile called **"yourOwnObjectDetectionModel"** It is using the AI model yolov4-tiny

# 0) Preparation:
You will need some tools to get everything working so please get these dependencies figured out before we start:
>* jupyter
>* opencv-python
>* Pillow
>* numpy
>* pywin32
>* pynput

# 1) Start Using
Open up the ipynb file in the repo on a jupyter notebook and also start up your game. Then follow the instructions in the file and you can run the cells one by one. Don't forget to change the windowName
parameter in the script! Here are some screenshot from our model:
